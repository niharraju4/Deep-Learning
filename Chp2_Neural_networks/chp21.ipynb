    "The problem we are trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28 pixels by 28 pixels), into their 10 categories (0 to 9). The dataset we will use is the MNIST dataset, a classic dataset in the machine learning community, which has been around for almost as long as the field itself and has been very intensively studied. It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s. You can think of \"solving\" MNIST as the \"Hello World\" of deep learning -- it's what you do to verify that your algorithms are working as expected."

    "    *   **Classification:** Assigning an input to a category. In this case, assigning a handwritten digit image to one of 10 categories (0-9).\n",
    "    *   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous value. For example, predicting the price of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why Categorical Crossentropy and Softmax?**\n",
    "    *   The MNIST problem is treated as a multi-class classification problem. Even though the classes are numbers, the model is not trying to predict a continuous value representing the digit. Instead, it's trying to classify the image into one of the discrete digit categories.\n",
    "    *   `categorical_crossentropy` is a loss function designed for multi-class classification. It compares the predicted probability distribution (output by softmax) with the true class label (represented as a one-hot encoded vector).\n",
    "    *   `softmax` activation outputs a probability distribution over the classes. Each number will have a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Why not Regression?**\n",
    "    *   You *could* theoretically treat it as a regression problem where you try to predict a value between 0 and 9. However, this would imply an ordinal relationship between the digits (e.g., 4 is \"closer\" to 5 than it is to 0), which isn't necessarily true for handwritten digits. A poorly written 4 might look more like a 9 than a well-written 5.\n",
    "    *   Classification allows the model to learn distinct features for each digit without imposing any artificial relationships between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **In summary:**\n",
    "    *   We use categorical labels and `categorical_crossentropy` because we're solving a multi-class classification problem.\n",
    "    *   This approach allows the model to learn distinct features for each digit and output a probability distribution over the possible digits.\n",
